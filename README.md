##  directory
These are the ELF x86-64 psABI LaTeX sources including
full history from the former subversion repository at svn.x86-64.org,
which is gone now.  For change please create pull requests after
discussing them at the x86-64-abi@googlegroups.com mailing list (whose
archives are at https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/x86-64-abi).

You need pdflatex for building these, then

    % make pdf

should give you abi.pdf.

## abitest/ directory
An old testsuite of some ABI traits, very old and imcomplete meanwhile,
just here for its history.
